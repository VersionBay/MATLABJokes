# Jokes in MATLAB Toolbox

Often at conferences or meetups there is a moment when the hosts need to distract the audience for a little. This Toolbox is meant to just show a funny joke from within MATLAB.

## Joke Guidelines

Jokes are meant to be shown at a MATLAB Meetup and put a smile on the audience face. This means that they are:

* not racist
* not sexual
* not political

## Contributing

If you know any cool jokes, create an Issue or a PR

## If you find a joke inappropriate

Please create an issue and we will remove the joke.
